# A Bunch of useful tools in python

Highlights:
* Random data generator that fills a template CSV file with dummy data that looks real.
* Bisection search algorithm. 
* String matching function that processes lines out of files when matches are found (great for 10,000 line error logs with 99% repetitive junk)
* March Madness tournament prediction algorithm that doesn't work (drat).


## How long does it take an art major to figure out how to code a Bisection Search Algorithm?

...about 3 hours.
